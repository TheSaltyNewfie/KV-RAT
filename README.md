# KV-RAT
## NOTE!!
This version of the tool is no longer beening maintained and is not at all ready nor stable, it is being remade in C++ with more stuff

## What is this?
In technical terms, this is a **Remote Access Tool**. I made this after a friend challenged me to make something that could mess with him on his computer. Made in mostly Python

## Disclaimer
Before I continue, **This was made for educational purposes and I am not liable for what you use this software for and what happens. ***I am not responsible for any thing people use this for. I made it to learn and I intend to never use it for bad intentions*****

## How to use
- To start the server, you will need
-- Python 3.10
All modules used for the server are native (This could change)

- To start the client
	- For debugging reasons, start with terminal first
	- Install these modules, 
		Pygame,
		pywinAPI
	- Change the address of the server to yours
	- Make sure the program starts as admin for some features

## Whats to come?
- This version of the tool is no longer in development

## Is this malicious?
While it can be used for malicious purposes, I made it for fun. I do not wish for it to be used for malicious purposes. It is detected by windows defender from my testing so unless the source is changed in someway, the client side will know something is on their computer. As said in the disclaimer, ***I am not responsible for any thing people use this for. I made it to learn and I intend to never use it for bad intentions***

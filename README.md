# KV-RAT
## What is this?
In technical terms, this is a **Remote Access Trojan**. I made this after a friend challenged me to make something that could mess with him on his computer. Made in mostly Python and Rust

## Disclaimer
Before I continue, **This was made for educational purposes and I am not liable for what you use this software for and what happens. ***I am not responsible for any thing people use this for. I made it to learn and I intend to never use it for bad intentions*****

## How to use
- To start the server, you will need
-- Python 3.10
All modules used for the server are native (This could change)

- To start the client
-- For debugging reasons, start with terminal first
-- Install these modules 
Pygame
pywinAPI
-- Change the address of the server to yours
-- Make sure the program starts as admin for some features

## Whats to come?
### ~3 Months
- File structure system to detect corruption
- File transfer
- Live video feed
### ~6 Months
- Server transition from Python to Rust or C++
- Server-sided VOIP
- Server-sided commands (For live editing of commands)
- Native scripting
-- This could be used for making new commands for the client side without manually editing the client
- Improved performance

## Is this malicious?
While it can be used for malicious purposes, I made it for fun. I do not wish for it to be used for malicious purposes. It is detected by windows defender from my testing so unless the source is changed in someway, the client side will know something is on their computer. As said in the disclaimer, ***I am not responsible for any thing people use this for. I made it to learn and I intend to never use it for bad intentions***
